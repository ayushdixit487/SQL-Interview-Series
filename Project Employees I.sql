Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the
employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.
The query result format is in the following example:
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1 | Khaled | 3 |
| 2 | Ali | 2 |
| 3 | John | 1 |
| 4 | Doe | 2 |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Result table:

Solution

Description
| project_id | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1 | 2.00 |
| 2 | 2.50 |
+-------------+---------------+
The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and
for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select project_id, round(avg(experience_years), 2) as average_years
from Project as p left join Employee as e on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
group by project_id;
